# 8x8TraxPositions
Database of lost and won 8x8Trax positions.

Feel free to ask me questions about how to use these positions in a
8x8trax AI program.

Please note that a full board without loops and lines is a **draw**.  
For some strange reason [traxgame.com](http://traxgame.com) now consider this a lose for the
player played the last piece!
